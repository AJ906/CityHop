# What is this?

CityHop is an app for travelers on the go. When you want or need to plan a trip in a short amount of time, you can use CityHop to get a snapshot of the weather, the events, and the buzz in popular cities.  Through the magic of APIs, this app allows travelers to view the weather conditions in five cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York), virtually build an itinerary in those cities, and get the latest social media buzz on those cities.

Additionally, we've added some styling (materialize and bootstrap) to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. We have included some snap shots of our visually appeabelow, but, to get the full effect, you should hop through the app.
